# Generative Adversarial Networks
*This purpose of this blog is a basic tutorial of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) proposed by Ian Goodfellow at OpenAI. The first part gives a brief introduction of GANs background and a practical application called Deep Constitutional Generative Adversarial Nerworks (DCGANs). The second part is an Python implementation of DCGANs on a small letter database: notMNIST. The original blog can be found on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ekss1121/generative-adversarial-networks-b9f80e6d7679).*
