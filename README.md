# Generative Adversarial Networks
*This blog introduce the background and the mechanism of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The first part gives a brief introduction of GANs background and its state-of -the-art. The machanism behind this algorithm are also introduced. The sceond part is an Python application of GANs on a small dataset.*
## Background
Generative Model is a type of model which can create new data similar with what we feed it. These model has gain large interest in recent years. In 2014, Ian Goodfellow published a paper introducing the world to a stuning Generative Model: Generative Adversial Networks or in short as GANs.The innovation behind this model is we have two deep learning netwokrs fighting with each other and aftert the the two network reach a equilibrium point (Nash Equilibrium), we can have two mature networks.
